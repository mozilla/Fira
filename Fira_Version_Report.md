Note:

All weights below ”Thin“ use fractional coordinates which is an optical decision. Rendering engines might not be able to deal with that correctly. As for that, these weights should be seen as an experiment by now. If you notice any problems in smaller sizes please consider to use weights from thin.

Weight ”Ultra“ is intended for extreme display usage. It is the result of an extrapolation (198 to 222) which is not optimized in typographical details. Please consider to use „Heavy“ instead if problems occur.

**Issues tagged „BUG“ on GitHub **

#57

line positioning in ie

Vertical metrics of official version remains unchanged until the test version is confirmed by so0ft on GitHub.

Setting typoLineGap to zero might lead to vertical metrics conflicts in other layouts/circumstances.

# 59

FsType indicating restricted embedding and subsetting 

fsType was „editable“, now set to „not set“ (installable). Should solve the problem.

Thank you n7s.

# 64

Delete positive kerning between f and u caused by a transfer glitch from FL to Glyphs

Thank you charakterziffer.

# 66

Greek tonos capitals with negative SB

Added some SB in the Black master of the following glyphs to ensure they don’t overlay the space in the bold weights. 

Thank you wfdd.
